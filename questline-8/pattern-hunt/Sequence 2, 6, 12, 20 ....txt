Sequence: 2, 6, 12, 20 ...

The differences between consecutive pair of terms in the sequences are
 6 - 2 = 4
 12 - 6 = 6
 20 - 12 = 8
So the differences are 4, 6, 8  which seems to be increasing by values of +2.
Following this pattern the difference of next two pairs will be '+10'and '+12'
 next two terms---> 20+10=30,30+12=42

SO,Sequence: 2, 6, 12, 20 ,30 ,42
